3. What is CDN? Why do we use it?
   - A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of servers that deliver web content to users based on their geographic location, improving load times and reducing latency.

4. Why is React known as React?
   - React is named for its ability to react to data changes, efficiently updating and rendering components to reflect these changes.

5. What is crossorigin in the script tag?
   - The `crossorigin` attribute in the script tag is used to handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) requests, specifying how the script should be fetched and handled.

6. What is the difference between React and ReactDOM?
   - React is the core library for building user interfaces, while ReactDOM is the library responsible for rendering React components to the DOM.

7. What is the difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
   - `react.development.js` includes helpful warnings and error messages for development, while `react.production.js` is optimized for performance and is minified for production use.

8. What is async and defer?
   - `async` loads the script asynchronously and executes it as soon as itâ€™s loaded, while `defer` loads the script in parallel and executes it after the HTML is fully parsed.
